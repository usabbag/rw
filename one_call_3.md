One Call API 3.0 - OpenWeatherMap
=================================

Product concept
---------------

Get essential weather data, short-term and long-term forecasts and aggregated weather data is easy with our OpenWeather **One Call API 3.0**. This product designed to ensure [easy migration from the Dark Sky API](https://openweathermap.org/darksky-openweather-3).

One Call API 3.0 contains 4 endpoints and provides access to various data:

*   [**Current weather and forecasts:**](#current)
    *   minute forecast for 1 hour
    *   hourly forecast for 48 hours
    *   daily forecast for 8 daysand government weather alerts
*   [**Weather data for any timestamp**](#history) for 46+ years historical archive and 4 days ahead forecast
*   [**Daily aggregation**](#history_daily_aggregation) of weather data for 46+ years archive and 1.5 years ahead forecast
*   [**Weather overview**](#weather_overview) with a human-readable weather summary for today and tomorrow's forecast, utilizing OpenWeather AI technologies

One Call API 3.0 is based on the proprietary [OpenWeather Model](https://openweather.co.uk/technology) and is updated every 10 minutes. Thus, in order to receive the most accurate and up-to-date weather data, we recommend you request One Call API 3.0 every 10 minutes.

Please note, that One Call API 3.0 is included in the ["One Call by Call"](https://openweathermap.org/price) subscription **only**. This separate subscription includes 1,000 calls/day for free and allows you to pay only for the number of API calls made to this product.
